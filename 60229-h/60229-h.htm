many copies
of “The Priest
and the Acolyte”
have
been sold by
unscrupulous publishers and
booksellers under the implication
that it is the work of
Oscar Wilde that it has been
thought good to issue this
edition with the object of putting
an end, once and for all,
to the possibility of purchasers
being misled as to the authorship.</p>
</div>

<p>The story was originally published
in <cite>The Chameleon</cite>, the
<a name="png.006" id="png.006" href="#png.006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>first and only number of which
appeared in December, 1894.
The author of the story was an
undergraduate at Oxford, “an
insufficiently birched schoolboy,”
as he has recently been
described, and he alone was
responsible for the contents of
the magazine which he edited.
At the time of the trial of Lord
Queensberry for libel a few
months later it was attempted to
show that Oscar Wilde not only
approved of the theme of the
story, but that he was actually
a party to the publication of it,
on the grounds that he sent to
the editor a number of aphorisms
under the title of “Phrases and
Philosophies for the Use of the
Young.”</p>

<p>The simplest way of showing
<a name="png.007" id="png.007" href="#png.007"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>what Oscar Wilde really thought
of the story is to quote what he
said when examined in Court on
the subject.</p>

<p>John Sholto Douglas, Eighth
Marquis of Queensberry, was
arrested on a warrant on March 1, 1895, on a charge of uttering
a criminal libel against Oscar
Wilde. On the following morning
he was brought up before
Mr. Newton at Marlborough
Street Police Court, and after
some formal evidence had been
taken was remanded on bail for
a week, and on the second hearing
was formally committed to
take his trial at the Central
Criminal Court a few weeks
later.</p>

<p>The trial began at the Old
Bailey on Wednesday, April 3,
<a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>before Mr. Justice Henn
Collins. Sir Edward Clarke,
Q.C., M.P., Mr. Charles Mathews
and Mr. Travers Humphreys
appeared for the prosecution;
Mr. Carson, Q.C., M.P.,
Mr. C. F. Gill and Mr. A. Gill
being for the defence.</p>

<p>The court was crowded. The
Marquis was the first to arrive.
He came in alone, and stood, hat
in hand, in front of the dock.
He spoke to no one, and no one
spoke to him. There was little
that was aristocratic in the
Marquis’s appearance. He was
of short stature, with a round
face, and clean shaven except
for a streak of red whisker. His
lower lip drooped considerably.
A few minutes before half-past
ten, Mr. Oscar Wilde entered the
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>court and took a seat immediately
in front of his Counsel,
with whom he at once joined in
an animated conversation.</p>

<p>The Judge was ten minutes
late, but (the Marquis having
entered the dock) the preliminary
proceedings were soon got
through, and at a quarter to
eleven, Sir Edward Clarke began
his speech for the prosecution.
Everybody listened attentively
to the story, as set forth by
Counsel, of the prosecutor’s
achievements at college, his
subsequent success as a littérateur,
and the circumstances
under which he became acquainted
with the defendant’s
family. “Phrases and Philosophies
for the Use of the Young,”
which Oscar Wilde contributed
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to <cite>The Chameleon</cite>, was mentioned
in the plea of the defence as
“immoral and obscene,” and
Sir Edward Clarke occupied
some time in an endeavour to
prove the contrary. With regard
to <cite>The Chameleon</cite>, Counsel
admitted that it contained a
story entitled “The Priest and
the Acolyte,” which could not
be justified, but he declared his
client could not be held responsible
for the publication as a
whole, he being but a contributor
to its pages. As a matter
of fact, Mr. Wilde urged upon
the editor that the book should
be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Carson began
his cross-examination, it became
apparent that the line he was
adopting would result in a
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>conflict between Counsel. Mr. Wilde was being questioned as
to his opinion on certain extracts
from “The Priest and the
Acolyte,” when Sir Edward
Clarke jumped to his feet and
appealed to the Judge whether
the questions were relevant, inasmuch
as Mr. Wilde was not
responsible for the story. The
Judge ruled in favour of Mr. Carson. Sir Edward, a few
minutes later, raised another
objection, but he was again overruled.</p>

<p>The interval for luncheon
came as a pleasant relief to all,
and, on the application of Mr. Carson, the Judge consented to
the defendant being allowed
his freedom till the court resumed
its sitting.</p>

<p><a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Sir Edward Clarke, in the
course of his speech for the prosecution,
said that there were two
extremely curious counts at the
end of the plea. One was that
in December, 1894, was “published
a certain immoral work
in the form of <cite>The Chameleon</cite>,
relating to practices and passions
of an unnatural kind,” and that
his client had “joined in procuring
the publication of <cite>The
Chameleon</cite>, with his name upon
it as the principal contributor.”
That was a very gross allegation.
Directly Mr. Wilde saw the magazine,
he noticed there was a
story in it called “The Priest
and the Acolyte,” which was a
disgrace to literature, which it
was amazing any body wrote, and
still more amazing that any body
<a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>allowed to be published under
his name.<a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1"
 href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>1<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> Directly Mr. Wilde
saw that story he communicated
with the editor, and upon
his insistence the magazine was
withdrawn. He had no knowledge
that that story was about
to be published. It was strange
indeed, then, to find that publication
put upon the particulars
as justifying the charge against
Mr. Wilde.</p>

<p>In his examination in chief, Sir Edward Clarke said: It is suggested
that you are responsible
for the publication of <cite>The
Chameleon</cite> on the front page of
which some aphorisms of yours
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>appear. Beyond sending that
contribution had you any thing
to do with the preparation or
ownership, editorship or publication
of that magazine?</p>

<p>Witness—No; nothing whatever.</p>

<p>Until you saw this number of
<cite>The Chameleon</cite> did you know
any thing about the story, “The
Priest and the Acolyte”?</p>

<p>Nothing at all.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the story in
print, did you communicate
with the editor?</p>

<p>The editor came to see me at
the Café Royal to speak to me
about it.</p>

<p>Did you approve of the story
of “The Priest and the Acolyte”?</p>

<p>I thought it bad and indecent,
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and I strongly disapproved of
it.</p>

<p>Was that disapproval expressed
to the editor?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde was then cross-examined
by Mr. Carson for the
defence.</p>

<p>You read “The Priest and the
Acolyte”?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>You have no doubt that that
was an improper story?</p>

<p>From the literary point of
view it was highly improper. It
is impossible for a man of literature
to judge it otherwise, by
literature meaning treatment,
selection of subject, and the like.
I thought the treatment rotten
and the subject rotten.</p>

<p>You are of opinion, I believe,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that there is no such thing as
an immoral book?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>May I take it that you think
“The Priest and the Acolyte”
was not immoral?</p>

<p>It was worse; it was badly
written.</p>

<p>Was not the story that of a
priest who fell in love with a boy
who served him at the altar,
and the boy was discovered in
the priest’s room, and a scandal
arose?</p>

<p>I have read it only once, in
November last, and nothing
will induce me to read it
again.</p>

<p>Did you think the story blasphemous?</p>

<p>I think it violated every artistic
canon of beauty.</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
That is not an answer.</p>

<p>It is the only one I can
give.</p>

<p>I want you to see the position
you pose in.</p>

<p>I do not think you should
say that.</p>

<p>I have said nothing out of the
way. I wish to know whether
you thought the story blasphemous.</p>

<p>The story filled me with disgust.</p>

<p>Answer the question, sir.
Did you, or did you not, consider
the story blasphemous?</p>

<p>I did not consider the story
blasphemous.</p>

<p>I am satisfied with that. You
know that when the priest in the
story administers poison to the
boy he uses the words of the
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Sacrament of the Church of
England?</p>

<p>That I entirely forgot.</p>

<p>Do you consider that blasphemous?</p>

<p>I think it is horrible. “Blasphemous”
is not the word.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson then read the
words describing the administration
of the poison in the
Sacrament, and asked Mr. Wilde whether he approved
of them.</p>

<p>The witness replied that he
thought them disgusting, perfect
twaddle.</p>

<p>I think you will admit that
any one who would approve of
such an article would pose as
guilty of improper practices?</p>

<p>I do not think so in the person
of another contributor to the
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>magazine. It would show very
bad literary taste. I strongly
objected to the whole story.
I took no steps to express public
disapproval of <cite>The Chameleon</cite>,
because I think it would have
been beneath my dignity as a
man of letters to associate myself
with an Oxford undergraduate’s
productions. I am
aware that the magazine might
have been circulated among
the undergraduates of Oxford,
but I do not believe that any
book or work of art ever had
any effect whatever on morality.</p>

<p>Am I right in saying that you
do not consider the effect in
creating morality or immorality?</p>

<p>Certainly, I do not.</p>

<p>So far as your own works are
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>concerned you pose as not
being concerned about morality
or immorality?</p>

<p>I do not know whether you
use the word “pose” in any
particular sense.</p>

<p>It is a favourite word of your
own.</p>

<p>Is it? I have no pose in this
matter. In writing a play or a
book I am concerned entirely
with literature, that is, with art.
I aim not at doing good or evil
but in trying to make a thing
that will have some quality of
beauty.</p>

<p>What would any body say
would be the effect of “Phrases
and Philosophies for the Use of
the Young” taken in connection
with such an article as “The
Priest and the Acolyte”?</p>

<p><a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
Undoubtedly, it was the idea
that might be formed that made
me object so strongly to the
story. I saw at once that maxims
that were perfectly nonsensical,
paradoxical or any thing you like,
might be read in conjunction
with it.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 30, which
was the fourth day of the first
trial of Oscar Wilde, Sir Edward
Clarke entered an emphatic
protest against Mr. Gill having
read over again the cross-examination
of the accused upon his
books and writings which he had
given at the trial of Lord
Queensberry. It was not fair
to judge of a man’s conduct by
his books, but the Prosecution
had gone much further than that,
and had sought to judge Wilde
<a name="png.022" id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by books which he did not write,
and by a story which he had
repudiated as horrible and disgusting.
Public opinion had
been excited and fanned by the
quotation in Court of passages of
literature for which he was not
responsible.</p>

<p>The subject then dropped, and
the next reference to it was
made by Mr. Justice Charles in
his summing up on the last
day of Oscar Wilde’s first trial
(May 1) when the Jury disagreed
and was unable to return
a verdict. His lordship said that
he did not propose to deal at
any length with the incidents of
the Queensberry trial, but that
it must be remembered that the
evidence of Wilde at that trial
was given on oath and must
<a name="png.023" id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not be lost sight of in considering
that which he had given the
previous day or two in that
Court. A very large portion
of the evidence of Wilde at the
Queensberry trial was devoted
to what Sir Edward Clarke had
called “the literary part of the
case,” and it had been attempted
to show by cross-examination
that Wilde was a man of most
unprincipled character with regard
to the relation of men to
boys. In regard to a magazine
called <cite>The Chameleon</cite>, published
in the autumn of 1894, it
was alleged that Wilde had given
the sanction of his name to the
most abominable doctrines, but
the only connection proved between
that magazine and the
defendant was that it was
<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>prefaced by two or three pages of
aphorisms by the accused, of
which it was sufficient to say that
some were amusing, some cynical,
some, if his lordship might
be allowed to criticize, silly;
but wicked, no.</p>

<p>The learned Counsel who
represented Lord Queensberry,
the Judge continued, had called
attention to a story, a filthy
narrative of a most disgusting
character, called “The Priest
and the Acolyte,” of which the
author, who signed himself “X,”
should be thoroughly ashamed.
With that story Wilde had had
nothing whatever to do, and to
impute to him any thing in it was
quite absurd. To judge him by
another man’s works which he
had never seen would be highly

In the second trial of Oscar
Wilde, which was heard before
Mr. Justice Willis on the following
May 22 to 25, no mention
was made of <cite>The Chameleon</cite> or
of “The Priest and the Acolyte.”</p>

<p>What is stated above ought to
be sufficient, once and for all, to
dissociate the name of the author

</div>

<p>The priest
started; he was tired in mind
and body; his soul was sad
and his heart heavy as he sat
in the terrible solitude of the
confessional ever listening to
the same dull round of oft-repeated
sins. He was weary
of the conventional tones
and matter-of-fact expressions.
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Would the world always be the
same? For nearly twenty centuries
the Christian priests had
sat in the confessional and listened
to the same old tale. The
world seemed to him no better;
always the same, the same. The
young priest sighed to himself,
and for a moment almost wished
people would be worse. Why
could they not escape from these
old wearily-made paths and be
a little original in their vices, if
sin they must? But the voice
he now listened to aroused him
from his reverie. It was so soft
and gentle, so diffident and shy.</p>

<p>He gave the blessing, and
listened. Ah, yes! he recognized
the voice now. It was the
voice he had heard for the first
time only that very morning:
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the voice of the little acolyte
that had served his Mass.</p>

<p>He turned his head and peered
through the grating at the little
bowed head beyond. There
was no mistaking those long
soft curls. Suddenly, for one
moment, the face was raised,
and the large moist blue eyes
met his; he saw the little oval
face flushed with shame at the
simple boyish sins he was confessing,
and a thrill shot through
him, for he felt that here at
least was something in the
world that was beautiful, something
that was really true. Would
the day come when those soft
scarlet lips would have grown
hard and false? when the soft
shy treble would have become
careless and conventional? His
<a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyes filled with tears, and in a
voice that had lost its firmness
he gave the absolution.</p>

<p>After a pause, he heard the boy
rise to his feet, and watched him
wend his way across the little
chapel and kneel before the
altar while he said his penance.
The priest hid his thin tired face
in his hands and sighed wearily.
The next morning, as he knelt
before the altar and turned to
say the words of confession to
the little acolyte whose head
was bent so reverently towards
him, he bowed low till his hair
just touched the golden halo that
surrounded the little face, and he
felt his veins burn and tingle
with a strange new fascination.</p>

<p>When that most wonderful
thing in the whole world,
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>complete soul-absorbing love for another,
suddenly strikes a man,
that man knows what heaven
means, and he understands hell:
but if the man be an ascetic,
a priest whose whole heart is
given to ecstatic devotion, it
were better for that man if he
had never been born.</p>

<p>When they reached the vestry
and the boy stood before him
reverently receiving the sacred
vestments, he knew that henceforth
the entire devotion of
his religion, the whole ecstatic
fervour of his prayers, would
be connected with, nay, inspired
by, one object alone.
With the same reverence and
humility as he would have felt in
touching the consecrated elements
he laid his hands on the
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>curl-crowned head, he touched
the small pale face, and, raising
it slightly, he bent forward and
gently touched the smooth white
brow with his lips.</p>

<p>When the child felt the caress
of his fingers, for one moment
every thing swam before his
eyes; but when he felt the
light touch of the tall priest’s
lips, a wonderful assurance took
possession of him: he understood.
He raised his little arms,
and, clasping his slim white
fingers around the priest’s neck
kissed him on the lips. With
a sharp cry the priest fell upon
his knees, and, clasping the little
figure clad in scarlet and lace to
his heart, he covered the tender
flushing face with burning kisses.
Then suddenly there came upon
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>them both a quick sense of fear;
they parted hastily, with hot
trembling fingers folded the
sacred vestments, and separated
in silent shyness.</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>The priest returned to his poor
rooms and tried to sit down and
think, but all in vain: he tried
to eat, but could only thrust
away his plate in disgust: he
tried to pray, but instead of the
calm figure on the cross, the
calm, cold figure with the
weary, weary face, he saw continually
before him the flushed
face of a lovely boy, the wide star-like
eyes of his new-found love.</p>

<p>All that day the young priest
went through the round of his
various duties mechanically, but
he could not eat nor sit quiet,
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for when alone, strange shrill
bursts of song kept thrilling
through his brain, and he felt
that he must flee out into the
open air or go mad.</p>

<p>At length, when night came,
and the long, hot day had left
him exhausted and worn out, he
threw himself on his knees before
his crucifix and compelled himself
to think.</p>

<p>He called to mind his boyhood
and his early youth; there
returned to him the thought
of the terrible struggles of the
last five years. Here he knelt,
Ronald Heatherington, priest of
Holy Church, aged twenty-eight:
what he had endured during
these five years of fierce battling
with those terrible passions he
had fostered in his boyhood,
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was it all to be in vain? For the
last year he had really felt that
all passion was subdued, all those
terrible outbursts of passionate
love he had really believed to be
stamped out for ever. He had
worked so hard, so unceasingly,
through all these five years since
his ordination—he had given
himself up solely and entirely to
his sacred office; all the intensity
of his nature had been concentrated,
completely absorbed,
in the beautiful mysteries of his
religion. He had avoided all that
could affect him, all that might
call up any recollection of his
early life. Then he had accepted
this curacy, with sole charge of
the little chapel that stood close
beside the cottage where he was
now living, the little mission-chapel
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that was the most distant
of the several grouped round the
old Parish Church of St. Anselm.
He had arrived only two
or three days before, and, going
to call on the old couple who
lived in the cottage, the back
of which formed the boundary
of his own little garden, had
been offered the services of
their grandson as acolyte.</p>

<p>“My son was an artist fellow,
sir,” the old man had said: “he
never was satisfied here, so we
sent him off to London; he
was made a lot of there, sir,
and married a lady, but the
cold weather carried him off one
winter, and his poor young wife
was left with the baby. She
brought him up and taught
him herself, sir, but last winter
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>she was taken too, so the poor
lad came to live with us—so
delicate he is, sir, and not one
of the likes of us; he’s a
gentleman born and bred, is
Wilfred. His poor mother used
to like him to go and serve at
the church near them in London,
and the boy was so fond of
it himself that we thought,
supposing you did not mind, sir,
that it would be a treat for him
to do the same here.”</p>

<p>“How old is the boy?”
asked the young priest.</p>

<p>“Fourteen, sir,” replied the
grandmother.</p>

<p>“Very well, let him come to
the chapel to-morrow morning,”
Ronald had agreed.</p>

<p>Entirely absorbed in his devotions,
the young man had
<a name="png.038" id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>scarcely noticed the little acolyte
who was serving for him, and
it was not till he was hearing
his confession later in the day
that he had realized his wonderful
loveliness.</p>

<p>“Ah God! help me! pity
me! After all this weary labour
and toil, just when I am beginning
to hope, is every thing to
be undone? am I to lose every
thing? Help me, help me, O
God!”</p>

<p>Even while he prayed; even
while his hands were stretched
out in agonized supplication
towards the feet of that crucifix
before which his hardest
battles had been fought and
won; even while the tears of
bitter contrition and miserable
self-mistrust were dimming his
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>eyes—there came a soft tap on
the glass of the window beside
him. He rose to his feet, and
wonderingly drew back the dingy
curtain. There in the moonlight,
before the open window,
stood a small white figure—there,
with his bare feet on the
moon-blanched turf, dressed
only in his long white night-shirt,
stood his little acolyte, the
boy who held his whole future
in his small childish hands.</p>

<p>“Wilfred, what are you doing
here?” he asked in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>“I could not sleep, father,
for thinking of you, and I saw a
light in your room, so I got
out through the window and
came to see you. Are you angry
with me, father?” he asked,
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his voice faltering as he saw the
almost fierce expression in the
thin ascetic face.</p>

<p>“Why did you come to see
me?” The priest hardly dared
recognize the situation, and
scarcely heard what the boy
said.</p>

<p>“Because I love you, I love
you—oh, so much! but you—you
are angry with me—oh,
why did I ever come! why did
I ever come!—I never thought
you would be angry!” and
the little fellow sank on the
grass and burst into tears.</p>

<p>The priest sprang through the
open window, and seizing the
slim little figure in his arms, he
carried him into the room. He
drew the curtain, and, sinking
into the deep arm-chair, laid the
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little fair head upon his breast,
kissing his curls again and again.</p>

<p>“O my darling! my own
beautiful darling!” he whispered,
“how could I ever be
angry with you? You are more
to me than all the world. Ah,
God! how I love you, my darling!
my own sweet darling!”</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the boy
nestled there in his arms, pressing
his soft cheek against his; then
the priest told him he must go.
For one long last kiss their lips
met, and then the small white-clad
figure slipped through the
window, sped across the little
moonlit garden, and vanished
through the opposite window.</p>

<p>When they met in the vestry
next morning, the lad raised
his beautiful flower-like face, and
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the priest, gently putting his
arms round him, kissed him
tenderly on the lips.</p>

<p>“My darling! my darling!”
was all he said; but the lad
returned his kiss with a smile of
wonderful almost heavenly love,
in a silence that seemed to whisper
something more than words.</p>

<p>“I wonder what was the
matter with the father this
morning?” said one old woman
to another, as they were returning
from the chapel; “he didn’t
seem himself at all; he made
more mistakes this morning than
Father Thomas made in all the
year he was here.”</p>

<p>“Seemed as if he had never
said a Mass before!” replied
her friend, with something of
contempt.</p>

<p><a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
And that night, and for
many nights after, the priest,
with the pale tired-looking face,
drew the curtain over his crucifix
and waited at the window for
the glimmer of the pale summer
moonlight on a crown of golden
curls, for the sight of slim boyish
limbs clad in the long white
night-shirt, that only emphasized
the grace of every movement,
and the beautiful pallor
of the little feet speeding
across the grass. There at the
window, night after night, he
waited to feel tender loving
arms thrown round his neck,
and to feel the intoxicating
delight of beautiful boyish lips
raining kisses on his own.</p>

<p>Ronald Heatherington made
no mistakes in the Mass now.
<a name="png.044" id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>He said the solemn words with
a reverence and devotion that
made the few poor people who
happened to be there speak of
him afterwards almost with awe;
while the face of the little
acolyte at his side shone with a
fervour which made them ask
each other what this strange
light could mean. Surely the
young priest must be a saint
indeed, while the boy beside
him looked more like an angel
from heaven than any child of
human birth.</p>




<h3 title="Part II" id="partii">PART II
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span

<div class="drop">
<img class="cap" src="images/dropt.jpg" alt="T" width="122" height="126"
 /><p class="cap">THE world is
very stern with
those that
thwart her.
She lays down
her precepts, and woe to those
who dare to think for themselves,
who venture to exercise
their own discretion as to
whether they shall allow their
individuality and natural characteristics
to be stamped out, to
be obliterated under the leaden
fingers of convention.</p>
</div>

<p>Truly, convention is the stone
that has become head of the
corner in the jerry-built temple
of our superficial, self-assertive
civilization.</p>

“<cite>And whosoever shall fall on
this stone shall be broken: but
on whomsoever it shall fall, it
will grind him to powder.</cite>”</p>

<p>If the world sees any thing she
cannot understand, she assigns
the basest motives to all concerned,
supposing the presence
of some secret shame, the idea
of which, at least, her narrow-minded
intelligence is able to
grasp.</p>

<p>The people no longer regarded
their priest as a saint, and his
acolyte as an angel. They still
spoke of them with bated breath
and with their fingers on their
lips; they still drew back out of
the way when they met either
of them; but now they gathered
together in groups of twos and
threes and shook their heads.</p>

<p><a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
The priest and his acolyte
heeded not; they never even
noticed the suspicious glances
and half-suppressed murmurs.
Each had found in the other
perfect sympathy and perfect
love: what could the outside
world matter to them now?
Each was to the other the perfect
fulfilment of a scarcely preconceived
ideal; neither heaven
nor hell could offer more. But
the stone of convention had
been undermined; the time
could not be far distant when
it must fall.</p>


<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>The moonlight was very clear
and very beautiful; the cool night
air was heavy with the perfume
of the old-fashioned flowers that
bloomed so profusely in the
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little garden. But in the priest’s
little room the closely drawn
curtains shut out all the beauty
of the night. Entirely forgetful
of all the world, absolutely
oblivious of every thing but one
another, wrapped in the beautiful
visions of a love that far
outshone all the splendour of
the summer night, the priest
and the little acolyte were together.</p>

<p>The little lad sat on his
knees with his arms closely
pressed round his neck and his
golden curls laid against the
priest’s close-cut hair; his white
night-shirt contrasting strangely
and beautifully with the dull
black of the other’s long cassock.</p>

<p>There was a step on the road
outside—a step drawing nearer
<a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and nearer; a knock at the
door. They heard it not; completely
absorbed in each other,
intoxicated with the sweetly
poisonous draught that is the
gift of love, they sat in silence.
But the end had come: the
blow had fallen at last. The
door opened, and there before
them in the doorway stood the
tall figure of the rector.</p>

<p>Neither said any thing; only
the little boy clung closer to his
beloved, and his eyes grew large
with fear. Then the young priest
rose slowly to his feet and put
the lad from him.</p>

<p>“You had better go, Wilfred,”
was all he said.</p>

<p>The two priests stood in
silence watching the child as
he slipped through the
<a name="png.050" id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>window, stole across the grass, and
vanished into the opposite
cottage.</p>

<p>Then the two turned and
faced each other.</p>

<p>The young priest sank into
his chair and clasped his hands,
waiting for the other to speak.</p>

<p>“So it has come to this!” he
said: “the people were only
too right in what they told me!
Ah, God! that such a thing
should have happened here!
that it has fallen on me to
expose your shame—our shame!
that it is I who must give you
up to justice, and see that you
suffer the full penalty of your
sin! Have you nothing to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing,” he replied
softly. “I cannot ask
for pity: I cannot explain:
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>you would never understand.
I do not ask you any thing for
myself, I do not ask you to
spare me; but think of the
terrible scandal to our dear
Church.”</p>

<p>“It is better to expose these
terrible scandals and see that
they are cured. It is folly to
conceal a sore: better show all
our shame than let it fester.”</p>

<p>“Think of the child.”</p>

<p>“That was for you to do:
you should have thought of
him before. What has his shame
to do with me? it was your
business. Besides, I would not
spare him if I could: what pity
can I feel for such as <span class="nw">he——?”</span></p>

<p>But the young man had risen,
pale to the lips.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he said in a low
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>voice; “I forbid you to speak of
him before me with any thing
but respect”; then softly to
himself, “with any thing but
reverence; with any thing but
devotion.”</p>

<p>The other was silent, awed
for the moment. Then his
anger rose.</p>

<p>“Dare you speak openly like
that? Where is your penitence,
your shame? have you no
sense of the horror of your sin?”</p>

<p>“There is no sin for which
I should feel shame,” he answered
very quietly. “God
gave me my love for him, and
He gave him also his love for
me. Who is there that shall
withstand God and the love
that is His gift?”</p>

<p>“Dare you profane the name
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by calling such a passion as this
‘love’?”</p>

<p>“It was love, perfect love: it
<em>is</em> perfect love.”</p>

<p>“I can say no more now;
to-morrow all shall be known.
Thank God, you shall pay dearly
for all this disgrace,” he added,
in a sudden outburst of wrath.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you have no
mercy;—not that I fear exposure
and punishment for myself. But
mercy can seldom be found from
a Christian,” he added, as one
that speaks from without.</p>

<p>The rector turned towards
him suddenly, and stretched
out his hands.</p>

<p>“Heaven forgive me my hardness
of heart,” he said. “I
have been cruel; I have spoken
cruelly in my distress. Ah,
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>can you say nothing to defend
your crime?”</p>

<p>“No: I do not think I can do
any good by that. If I attempted
to deny all guilt, you
would only think I lied: though
I should prove my innocence,
yet my reputation, my career,
my whole future, are ruined for
ever. But will you listen to me
for a little? I will tell you a
little about myself.”</p>

<p>The rector sat down while
his curate told him the story
of his life, sitting by the empty
grate with his chin resting on
his clasped hands.</p>

<p>“I was at a big public school,
as you know. I was always
different from other boys. I
never cared much for games.
I took little interest in those
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>things for which boys usually
care so much. I was not very
happy in my boyhood, I think.
My one ambition was to find
the ideal for which I longed.
It has always been thus: I
have always had an indefinite
longing for something, a vague
something that never quite took
shape, that I could never quite
understand. My great desire
has always been to find something
that would satisfy me.
I was attracted at once by sin:
my whole early life is stained
and polluted with the taint
of sin. Sometimes even now
I think that there are sins more
beautiful than any thing else in
the world. There are vices that
are bound to attract almost
irresistibly any one who loves
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beauty above every thing. I
have always sought for love:
again and again I have been
the victim of fits of passionate
affection: time after time I
have seemed to have found my
ideal at last: the whole object
of my life has been, times
without number, to gain the
love of some particular person.
Several times my efforts were
successful; each time I woke to
find that the success I had
obtained was worthless after
all. As I grasped the prize, it
lost all its attraction—I no
longer cared for what I had once
desired with my whole heart.
In vain I endeavoured to drown
the yearnings of my heart with
the ordinary pleasures and vices
that usually attract the young.
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I had to choose a profession. I
became a priest. The whole
æsthetic tendency of my soul
was intensely attracted by the
wonderful mysteries of Christianity,
the artistic beauty of
our services. Ever since my
ordination I have been striving
to cheat myself into the belief
that peace had come at last—at
last my yearning was satisfied:
but all in vain. Unceasingly
I have struggled with the
old cravings for excitement,
and, above all, the weary, incessant
thirst for a perfect love.
I have found, and still find, an
exquisite delight in religion:
not in the regular duties of a
religious life, not in the ordinary
round of parish organizations;—against
these I chafe incessantly;—no,
<a name="png.058" id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>my delight is in the æsthetic
beauty of the services, the
ecstasy of devotion, the passionate
fervour that comes with long
fasting and meditation.”</p>

<p>“Have you found no comfort
in prayer?” asked the rector.</p>

<p>“Comfort?—no. But I have
found in prayer pleasure, excitement,
almost a fierce delight
of sin.”</p>

<p>“You should have married.
I think that would have saved
you.”</p>

<p>Ronald Heatherington rose to
his feet and laid his hand on the
rector’s arm.</p>

<p>“You do not understand me.
I have never been attracted by
a woman in my life. Can you
not see that people are different,
totally different, from one
<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>another? To think that we are
all the same is impossible; our
natures, our temperaments, are
utterly unlike. But this is what
people will never see; they
found all their opinions on a
wrong basis. How can their
deductions be just if their premisses
are wrong? One law laid
down by the majority, who
happen to be of one disposition,
is only binding on
the minority <em>legally</em>, not <em>morally</em>.
What right have you, or
any one, to tell me that such
and such a thing is sinful for
me? Oh, why can I not explain
to you and force you to see?”
and his grasp tightened on the
other’s arm. Then he continued,
speaking fast and <span class="nw">earnestly:—</span></p>

<p><a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“For me, with my nature, to
have married would have been
sinful: it would have been a
crime, a gross immorality, and
my conscience would have revolted.”
Then he added, bitterly:
“Conscience should be
that divine instinct which bids
us seek after that our natural
disposition needs—we have forgotten
that; to most of us, to
the world, nay, even to Christians
in general, conscience is
merely another name for the
cowardice that dreads to offend
against convention. Ah, what
a cursed thing convention is!
I have committed no moral
offence in this matter; in the
sight of God my soul is blameless;
but to you and to the
world I am guilty of an
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>abominable crime—abominable, because
it is a sin against convention,
forsooth! I met this boy:
I loved him as I had never
loved any one or any thing before:
I had no need to labour to
win his affection—he was mine
by right: he loved me, even as
I loved him, from the first: he
was the necessary complement to
my soul. How dare the world
presume to judge us? What
is convention to us? Nevertheless,
although I really knew
that such a love was beautiful
and blameless, although from
the bottom of my heart I
despised the narrow judgment
of the world, yet for his sake and
for the sake of our Church, I
tried at first to resist. I struggled
against the fascination he
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>possessed for me. I would never
have gone to him and asked his
love; I would have struggled
on till the end: but what could
I do? It was he that came to
me, and offered me the wealth of
love his beautiful soul possessed.
How could I tell to such a
nature as his the hideous picture
the world would paint?
Even as you saw him this
evening, he has come to me night
by night,—how dare I disturb
the sweet purity of his soul by
hinting at the horrible suspicions
his presence might arouse? I
knew what I was doing. I
have faced the world and set
myself up against it. I have
openly scoffed at its dictates.
I do not ask you to sympathize
with me, nor do I pray you to
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stay your hand. Your eyes are
blinded with a mental cataract.
You are bound, bound with
those miserable ties that have
held you body and soul from
the cradle. You must do what
you believe to be your duty.
In God’s eyes we are martyrs,
and we shall not shrink even
from death in this struggle
against the idolatrous worship
of convention.”</p>

<p>Ronald Heatherington sank
into a chair, hiding his face in
his hands, and the rector left
the room in silence.</p>

<p>For some minutes the young
priest sat with his face buried
in his hands. Then with a
sigh he rose and crept across
the garden till he stood beneath
the open window of his darling.</p>

<p><a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
“Wilfred,” he called very
softly.</p>

<p>The beautiful face, pale and
wet with tears, appeared at
the window.</p>

<p>“I want you, my darling;
Will you come?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” the boy softly
answered.</p>

<p>The priest led him back to
his room; then, taking him
very gently in his arms, he tried
to warm the cold little feet with
his hands.</p>

<p>“My darling, it is all over.”
And he told him as gently as
he could all that lay before
them.</p>

<p>The boy hid his face on his
shoulder, crying softly.</p>

<p>“Can I do nothing for you,
dear father?”</p>

<p><a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>
He was silent for a moment.
“Yes, you can die for me; you
can die with me.”</p>

<p>The loving arms were about
his neck once more, and the
warm, loving lips were kissing
his own. “I will do any thing
for you. O father, let us die
together!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my darling, it is best:
we will.”</p>

<p>Then very quietly and very
tenderly he prepared the little
fellow for his death; he heard
his last confession and gave him
his last absolution. Then they
knelt together, hand in hand,
before the crucifix.</p>

<p>“Pray for me, my darling.”</p>

<p>Then together their prayers
silently ascended that the dear
Lord would have pity on the
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>priest who had fallen in the
terrible battle of life. There
they knelt till midnight, when
Ronald took the lad in his arms
and carried him to the little
chapel.</p>

<p>“I will say mass for the
repose of our souls,” he said.</p>

<p>Over his night-shirt the child
arrayed himself in his little
scarlet cassock and tiny lace
cotta. He covered his naked
feet with the scarlet sanctuary
shoes; he lighted the tapers and
reverently helped the priest to
vest. Then before they left
the vestry the priest took him
in his arms and held him pressed
closely to his breast; he stroked
the soft hair and whispered
cheeringly to him. The child
was weeping quietly, his
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>slender frame trembling with the
sobs he could scarcely suppress.
After a moment the tender
embrace soothed him, and he
raised his beautiful mouth to
the priest’s. Their lips were
pressed together, and their arms
wrapped one another closely.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, my own
sweet darling!” the priest whispered
tenderly.</p>

<p>“We shall be together for
ever soon; nothing shall separate
us now,” the child said.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is far better so; far
better to be together in death
than apart in life.”</p>

<p>They knelt before the altar in
the silent night, the glimmer
of the tapers lighting up the
features of the crucifix with
strange distinctness. Never
<a name="png.068" id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had the priest’s voice trembled
with such wonderful earnestness,
never had the acolyte responded
with such devotion, as at this
midnight Mass for the peace
of their own departing souls.</p>

<p>Just before the consecration
the priest took a tiny phial from
the pocket of his cassock, blessed
it, and poured the contents
into the chalice.</p>

<p>When the time came for
him to receive from the chalice,
he raised it to his lips, but
did not taste of it.</p>

<p>He administered the sacred
wafer to the child, and then
he took the beautiful gold chalice,
set with precious stones,
in his hand; he turned towards
him; but when he saw
the light in the beautiful face
<a name="png.069" id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>he turned again to the crucifix
with a low moan. For one
instant his courage failed him;
then he turned to the little
fellow again, and held the chalice
to his lips:</p>

<p>“<cite>The Blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ, which was shed for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto
everlasting life.</cite>”</p>

<p>Never had the priest beheld
such perfect love, such perfect
trust, in those dear eyes as shone
from them now; now, as with
face raised upwards he received
his death from the loving hands
of him that he loved best in
the whole world.</p>

<p>The instant he had received,
Ronald fell on his knees beside
him and drained the chalice to
the last drop. He set it down
<a name="png.070" id="png.070" href="#png.070"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and threw his arms round the
beautiful figure of his dearly
loved acolyte. Their lips met
in one last kiss of perfect love,
and all was over.</p>


<div class="keeptogether">
<p class="tb"><span class="ns"><br
 /></span>When the sun was rising in
the heavens it cast one broad
ray upon the altar of the little
chapel. The tapers were burning
still, scarcely half-burnt
through. The sad-faced figure
of the crucifix hung there in its
majestic calm. On the steps
of the altar was stretched the
long, ascetic frame of the young
priest, robed in the sacred
vestments; close beside him,
with his curly head pillowed on
the gorgeous embroideries that
covered his breast, lay the beautiful
boy in scarlet and lace.
<a name="png.071" id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Their arms were round each
other; a strange hush lay like a
shroud over all.</p>

<p>“<cite>And whomever shall fall on
this stone shall be broken: but
on whomsoever it shall fall, it will
grind him to powder.</cite>”</p>
